Java implementation of the CoAP protocol (draft 08) (see: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-08)
usable for both clients and servers including extensions:

<h3>CoAP observe (draft 06)</h3>
see: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-observe-06

<h3> CoAP block-transfer (draft 04, partially)</h3>
see: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block-04<br>
<br>
For now, the blockwise transfer only works for clients receiving blockwise responses

<h3>Documentation</h3>

The API documentation is available at http://media.itm.uni-luebeck.de/people/kleine/ncoap-1.0-snapshot/apidoc/.

To get started with using the nCoAP framework I refer to https://github.com/okleine/SimpleCoapApplications.
